# pyacademic: set of academic tools build during my WUT journey

Consists of:
* [toler](toler/) - quick tolerance table cheat-sheet
* bpm2csv.py - got to hate those proprietary lab formats
* pwplot.py - plotting tool for quick plots based on matplotlib, _build in progress_
* texutil.py - yay, export sympy (probably more than) to LaTeX table format
* [svg_graph](svg_graph/) - _inop_, svg graphing lib primary intended for hyd/pneu element movement drawings
* [misc/](misc/) - directory for non-python utilities
	* [tex/](misc/tex/) - $\LaTeX$ template for WUT
