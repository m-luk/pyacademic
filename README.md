# pyacademic: set of academic tools build during my WUT journey

Consists of:
* toler.py - quick tolerance table cheat-sheet
* bpm2csv.py - got to hate those proprietary lab formats
* pwplot.py - currently _inop_, plotting tool
* texutil.py - yay, export sympy (probably more than) to LaTeX table format
